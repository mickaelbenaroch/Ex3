                <p>Well, first of all your full name is <input class="inp" placeholder="Your Full Name " name="fullName" autocomplete="on">.We will play a little game: You have to find and fill the inputs fields. There are 11 in this special form. I mixes 11 input types. You just found the first one but be carefull the text doesn't make sense. It's only here to make you crazy. So jump into the text and find the blanks inputs. Ok, so if you understand, jump to the next paragraph, cause this one is only blah blah blah. See you there.Teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power.</p> <p>Ok it's the time to tape your password in the field <input class="inp" type="password" name="pass" placeholder="Your password" minlength="8" required>
                title="Enter an ID consisting of 4-8 hexadecimal digits"> and you can pass to the next column.Like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p></div>

                The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  So, it's time to put your email just here <input class="inp" type="email" name="mail" placeholder="Fill Your E-mail"  autocomplete="on" required>. Right! You are not bad. The next field is in the 7th line from here. Go there. The crowd far away on the left, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. Tape your phone number right here your.But be careful there is a pattern in this field. you have to pu a number build like this: 3 numbers,put a ' - ', 3 numbers, put a '- ', and 4 numbers <input class="inp" type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone Number" autocomplete="on" required pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}"> Good job! the next field is in the next line in small characters. Find it.</p>

                <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

                <p>Then I saw some cabmen I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men. This is an easy one: How much fields did you find from the begining? <input class="inp3" type="number" name="coffee"  min="1" max="7"></p>

            <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">The End is close </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.Ok! so how old are you my dear reader?<select class="inp2" name="age">
                <option value="under 18">under 18</option>

                <option value="up to 41">up to 41</option>
            </select> </p>

                <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. If you read this, you finished. You just have to submit the form, the submit is by clicking on the biggest 2 words in this page.
